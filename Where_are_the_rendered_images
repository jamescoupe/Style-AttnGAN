Where are the rendered images written?

Its complicated:

The NET_G variable is defined in,
	Style-AttnGAN/code/cfg/eval_bird_style.yml

 
as


NET_G: '../models/bak20210705/orig_models/bird_StyleAttnGAN2/ + 



then there is an 'example_filenames.txt' in,

DATA_DIR: '../data/birds'

pointing to,

Style-AttnGAN/data/birds/example_filenames.txt 


the contents of which is '20210614',


which is appended to the model directory as an output location,


so the result is (in this case) :


	Style-AttnGAN/ +

	models/bak20210705/orig_models/bird_StyleAttnGAN2/  +


	20210614/ +

	(YYMMDD) 210805/ +

The files, which are png's, and HTML.
